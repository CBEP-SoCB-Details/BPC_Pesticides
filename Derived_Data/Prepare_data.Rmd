# Introduction
This notebook prepares BPC Pesticides data from Casco Bay for further analysis.

## Sediment Data
In 2014 and 2015, the Maine Board of Pesticides Control collected sediment
samples from the Coast of Maine and Casco Bay, and analyzed them for presence of
selected pesticides, especially certain pyrethroid pesticides.

The only pyrethroid that was observed consistently was bifenthrin, perhaps
because bifenthrin could be detected in sediment samples at substantially lower
concentrations than the other  pesticides on the testing panel.  Concentrations
(expressed on  organic carbon weighted basis) were on the order of one and a
half to two orders of magnitude below LC50 values for two species of crustaceans
for which sediment toxicity data were available.
 
Our principal goal is to produce a MAP of average bifenthrin concentrations and
a FIGURE showing the relationship between bifenthrin concentration and extent of
nearby impervious surfaces (as a rough measure of urbanization).

## Stormwater Samples
In 2015, the BPC collected stormwater samples from streams and storm drain
outfalls near where sediment samples were collected in 2014.  These samples were
analyzed both for pyrethroids and for a comprehensive list of 101 pesticides
(see 'Anylate_Lists_2010.xlsx'), including insecticides, herbicides, and
fungicides.  The list of pesticides does not include banned organochlorine
pesticides like DDT and Chlordane, but focuses on pesticides in present-day use,
many of which are thought to have relatively short lifespans in the aquatic
environment.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()

library(LCensMeans)
```

# Load Data
## File References
```{r file_refs}
conc_fn <- 'BPC_2014_2015_Sediment_Data.txt'
geogr_fn <- 'imperviousness.txt'
storm_fn <- 'BPC_2015_Stormwater_Data.txt'
```

## Load IC Data
Note that the total IC coverage listed includes IC within  the designated
radius of the sample point.  Since each sample point is on a shoreline, a 
portion of that circle lies in the ocean, and is not on land.  Thus the percent
imperviousness calculated here (based on the TOTAL area of those circles, not
the LAND area within those circles) underestimates local IC, but provides a
better estimate of the potential impact of overall urbanization on local
conditions.  
```{r ic_data}
ic_data <- read.delim(geogr_fn, sep = ',') %>%
  select(-OBJECTID, -Latitude, -Longitude) %>%
  rename(yr = 'Year_') %>%
  mutate(pctI500 = imperv500 / (pi*500^2),
         pctI1000 = imperv1000 / (pi*1000^2),
         pctI2000 = imperv2000 / (pi*2000^2)) %>%
  filter(Location != 8)       # Remove Boothbay Location
```

## Load Pyrethroid Concentration Data
```{r concentration_data}
conc_data <- read.delim(conc_fn, skip = 1) %>%
  select(1:15)
```

## Load Stormwater Data
While we load the Stormwater Data, data is from a handful of sites, and we
observe only a handful of pesticides regularly.  We do not conduct any further
analysis with it here

The most frequently observed pesticides are 
```{r stormwater_data}
storm_data <- read.delim(storm_fn, skip = 1)
```


# Calculate Sediment Site Bifenthrin Averages
Here we use a function from CBEP's LCensMeans package to estimate the maximum
likelihood value of the (unobserved) concentrations in non-detects. It offers a
statistically better justified estimate than replacing non-detects with the
detection or reporting limit.

We calculate site averages, effectively pooling results from multiple samples
from individual sampling locations.  This hides temporal trends, but is just 
what we need to prepare GIS maps.

Note that one of two Little Flying Point replicates was a non-detect, the other
was not, so pooling the  two values is problematic.  We proceed anyway.


```{r avg_data}
avg_data <- conc_data %>%
  group_by(LocCode) %>%
  summarize(across(Coarse:BTU_E, mean, na.rm=TRUE), .groups='drop') %>%
  mutate(Bifenthrin_ND = Bifenthrin_ND>0) %>%
  mutate(pct500   = ic_data$pctI500[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)],
         pct1000  = ic_data$pctI1000[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)],
         pct2000  = ic_data$pctI2000[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)])


ml_estimator_Raw <- sub_cmeans(avg_data$Bifenthrin_Raw,
                                               avg_data$Bifenthrin_ND)
avg_data <- avg_data %>%
  mutate(Bifenthrin_ML     = ml_estimator_Raw) %>%
  mutate(Bifenthrin_OC_QML = Bifenthrin_ML * 100* (100/(100-Moisture)) / TOC)
```

## Correlations
```{r correlations_1}
cor(avg_data[c(8, 10, 2:7)], use = 'pairwise')
```
As expected, Bifenthrin concentrations are positively correlated with silt,
clay, total organic carbon, and moisture.  The pesticide is concentrated in
depositional environments. Conversely, it is negatively correlated with
sand.

```{r correlations_2}
cor(avg_data[c(8, 10, 13:15)], use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')
```
The correlations with the IC metrics are important.  The radius around each
sampling point makes only a small difference in the correlation.  Repeating the
analysis with Spearman's Rank Correlations or Kendall's Tau does not change the
general conclusions (not shown).

## Export summary table
```{r export_data}
avg_data %>% select(-BTU_E, -BTU_H, - pct500, -pct1000, -pct2000) %>%
  write_csv('bifenthrin_by_site.csv')
```

# Import IC metrics into conc_data
```{r add_IC_metrics and ml}
ml_estimator_Raw <- sub_cmeans(conc_data$Bifenthrin_Raw,
                                               conc_data$Bifenthrin_ND)

conc_data <- conc_data %>%
  mutate(pct500   = ic_data$pctI500[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)],
         pct1000  = ic_data$pctI1000[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)],
         pct2000  = ic_data$pctI2000[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)]) %>%
  mutate(Bifenthrin_ML = ml_estimator_Raw) %>%
  mutate(Bifenthrin_OC_QML = Bifenthrin_ML * 100* (100/(100-Moisture)) / TOC)
```

Analysis of data from 2014 and 2015 Maine Board of Pesticides Control marine sediment and water sampling for selected pesticides.

# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our State of the Bay data archives ensure the science underlying the 2020 State of the Bay report is documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to release raw data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science. 

# Archive Structure
 CBEP 2020 State of the Bay data analysis repositories are divided into from two to four sub-folders.  All archives contain at least an "Original_Data" and a "Graphics" folder.  The other two folders are only included if strictly necessary. 

- Original Data.  Original data, with a "DATA_SOURCES.md" or "READ ME.txt" file that documents data sources.  
    **DATA IN THIS FOLDER IS AS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED OR ACCESSED.** 

- Derived Data.  Data derived from the original raw data.  Includes documentation of data reorganization steps, either in the form of files (R notebooks, Excel files, etc.) that embody data transformations, or via another README.txt file.  
- Analysis.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding through the data analysis steps.  
- Graphics.  Contains R Notebooks stepping through development of related graphics, and also raw copies of resulting graphics, usually in \*.png and \*.pdf formats.  These graphics may differ from graphics as they appear in final State of the Bay graphical layouts.  

# Summary of Data Sources
Maine Board of Pesticides Control staff collected sediment samples along the Coast of Maine in 20 (is this supposed to be 2014-2015

## Sediment Sampling
BPC Staff conducted intertidal sediment sampling at 20 locations along the Coast of Maine in 2014. In 2015 Samples were collected specifically in Casco Bay.  The sampling locations in 2015 included heavily populated shorelines as well as shorelines of unpopulated islands. Sediment samples were analyzed for a limited number of pesticides and pesticide constituents, principally pyrethroids.

## Stormwater Sampling
BPC staff and volunteers collected stormwater samples along the coast of Maine (at sites close to where the intertidal sediment samples were collected in 2014)  in August of 2015.  All water samples were collected within 24 hours of each other, allowing for the timing of the storm as it took a southwest to northeast path across the coastal sampling area. Samples were analyzed for a larger group of pesticides and pesticide residues.
